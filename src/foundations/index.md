## Our philosphy
Our Product Design Principles reflect how we think about design. They provide a way for us to look at the work we create and how we create it: **Building the right thing; building the thing right ‚Äì distinctively Shopware.**

**We build products that put people and the planet first.**

**We at Shopware strive to build a better tomorrow every day.**

As designers and engineers, it's our responsibility to reduce Shopware's footprint in mother nature. Even small decisions we make can have an impact on our carbon footprint. Build products that last longer and follow a sustainable purpose. Always reflect on a product's impact ‚Äì think about reducing file size, turn off your monitor while at lunch or maybe even consider implementing a dark mode that drastically reduces energy consumption. 

**Create products with purpose and always prefer the sustainable, long-lasting option when thinking about merchandising, events or physical products.**
