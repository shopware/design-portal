# Design Principles

## Our philosphy
Our Product Design Principles reflect how we think about design. They provide a way for us to look at the work we create and how we create it: **Building the right thing; building the thing right – distinctively Shopware.**

### 🚴 Reduce Friction, aim for Simplicity

### 🍦 Streamlined and Consistent Experiences

Prioritize delivering streamlined and consistent experiences by utilizing our design system. Reduce cognitive load by maintaining consistency in layouts, design elements, typography, and interactions accross our products to enhance user satisfaction.

### 😇 Ethical Design Practices

**We build products that put people and the planet first.**

**We at Shopware strive to build a better tomorrow every day.**

As designers and engineers, it's our responsibility to reduce Shopware's footprint in mother nature. Even small decisions we make can have an impact on our carbon footprint. Build products that last longer and follow a sustainable purpose. Always reflect on a product's impact – think about reducing file size, turn off your monitor while at lunch or maybe even consider implementing a dark mode that drastically reduces energy consumption. 

**Create products with purpose and always prefer the sustainable, long-lasting option when thinking about merchandising, events or physical products.**
