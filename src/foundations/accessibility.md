## Our Approach
To achieve true accessibility, we adhere to the industry-leading guidelines set forth by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <code>(WCAG) 2.1 AA</code> and Barrier-Free Information Technology Regulation <code>(BITV 2.0)</code>. These guidelines are paramount in shaping web accessibility standards and will serve as the foundation for the upcoming accessibility law, the "Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetz," which will be effective for all webshops in Germany in 2024.

## Our Commitment
Our commitment extends beyond compliance. We are determined to be fully prepared well before the accessibility law takes effect. While we may not currently conform to all aspects of <code>WCAG 2.1 AA</code>, we are working diligently to bridge the gap. Our target is to achieve full conformance by the end of the year, ensuring our merchants' online shops are accessible to all.

## Roadmap
**Understanding WCAG Guidelines**
- Familiarizing the entire company with the WCAG guidelines, particularly <code>WCAG 2.1</code>, which provides a comprehensive framework for web accessibility at Shopware.
- Studying how the principles of Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust affect our product.

**Setting Accessibility Goals**
- Defining clear accessibility goals and objectives for our product. In the first step we decided on a conformance level of at least AA based on your target audience and legal requirements.

**Implement Changes**
- Start making changes to your product based on (audit findings and) focus areas.
- Updating our code and make necessary structural alternations.
- Initiating organizational structures to ensure new content and features will also be designed with accessibility in mind.

**User Testing**
- We engage with users with disabilities for testing and feedback an incorporate their insights to refine our changes.
- This includes performing usability testing with assistive technologies such as screen readers and voice commands.

**Education and Training**
- Training our development and design teams on accessibility principles and techniques.
- Fostering a culture of accessibility awareness within the Shopware organization.

**Documentation**
- Documenting our accessibility efforts, guidelines, and standards.
- Creating an accessibility statement or page that informs users about your commitment to accessibility.

**Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**
- Accessibility is an ongoing process. We continuously monitor our product for new accessibility challenges.
- Staying updated with the latest WCAG guidelines and accessibility practices.

## Our Promise
Shopware is unwavering in its dedication to fostering a digital environment that's welcoming and accessible for everyone. We understand that accessibility is an ongoing journey, and we're committed to continuous improvement. Our shared goal is to empower our merchants to connect with a wider audience and offer unparalleled shopping experiences.
