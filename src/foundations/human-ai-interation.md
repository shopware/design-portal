Designing for Human-AI interaction requires a user-centric approach that prioritizes ease of use, clear communication, and continuous improvement. By following these guidelines, you can create an AI feature that seamlessly integrates with the merchants workflow and enhances their productivity and efficiency.

### Initially
- Explain the benefit, not the technology _(Explain what)_
- Set the right expectations _(Explain how well)_
- Be transparent about privacy and data sharing

### During interaction
- Provide contextually relevant information
- Enable merchants to review and approve options
- Ensure immediate and clear feedback from the AI, indicating that it has received the input and is processing it.

### When wrong
- Be accountable for errors
- Support correction, dismissal and invocation
- Enable the merchant to access why the AI did what it did (Documentation)

### Over time
- Provide global controls to enable merchants to customize their experience
- Learn from actions over time and personalize the merchants experience
- Inform the merchant about changes of AI capabilities or updates

## Content review
While AI can be incredibly useful in automating repetitive tasks and producing content at scale, it is important to keep in mind that it is not a substitute for human creativity, nuance, and empathy. AI-generated content can lack the emotional depth, cultural awareness, and ethical considerations essential to producing high-quality content that resonates with audiences.

Therefore, merchants must be able to review or preview AI-generated content before it is published or shared with an audience. 

- AI-generated content should never replace human-generated content without a review or approval by a human. 
- To differentiate human-generated content from AI-generated content, the AI Copilot icon or a light blue background behind generated text should be used to indicate AI-generated content visually.
- Merchants should be able to remove, edit or update AI-generated content at any time.
