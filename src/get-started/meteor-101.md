## Meteor’s mission
  Meteor serves as the bedrock for all of Shopware's products, a unified system encompassing components, styles, visuals, and guidelines. It helps us work together more efficiently and provides a unified process across teams. This collective approach ensures the creation of empowering and delightful experiences for all merchants within the Shopware ecosystem.
