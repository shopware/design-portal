## People-First principle
Language not only has the power to build bridges and increase understanding, but also the capability to alienate and dismiss.

When we think about inclusivity, we champion <code>people-first language</code>. 

This means that we keep the individual as the most important part of the sentiment and don’t concentrate on characteristics like gender, sexual orientation, religion, racial group, or ability unless it's relevant to the discussion. Some of this is new or can be confusing, so if you aren’t sure, ask. Strive to include language that reflects peoples’ choice and style in how they talk about themselves.

  ## Race and ethnicity

  ### Best practices
- Avoid stereotyping or positive/negative generalizations
- Avoid promotion of ethnic or racial invisibility


<UsageBlock>
  <template #correct>
    Use more direct language. For example “allowlist” and “blocklist”
  </template>
  <template #incorrect>
    “Black” or “white”
  </template>
</UsageBlock>

::: info Reasoning
When referring to positive or negative or good or bad things. It implies their one is better than the other.
:::

<UsageBlock>
  <template #correct>
    “main”, “primary”
  </template>
  <template #incorrect>
    “master”
  </template>
</UsageBlock>

::: info Reasoning
References slavery.
:::

  ## Sexism

  ### Best practices
- Use gender neutral language.
- Reduce unnecessary or irrelevant references to personal characteristics based on gender and male-related terms.
- Avoid referencing a person’s gender except where it is pertinent to the discussion.
- Don’t use language that privileges men and renders women invisible or inferior.

<UsageBlock>
  <template #correct>
    "they"
  </template>
  <template #incorrect>
    "him" or "her", "he" or "she"
  </template>
</UsageBlock>
<UsageBlock>
  <template #correct>
    "people", "folks", "teammates"
  </template>
  <template #incorrect>
    "guys"
  </template>
</UsageBlock>

::: info Reasoning
Not gender neutral, renders women invisible.
:::

<UsageBlock>
  <template #correct>
    use neutral, straightforward titles
  </template>
  <template #incorrect>
    "ninja" or "rockstar" or "wizard"
  </template>
</UsageBlock>

::: info Reasoning
Semi-gendered - studies have shown that (specifically in job descriptions) women or members of LGBTQ+ are less likely to apply when these types of descriptors are used (also “competitive” or “determined”). Conversely, “cooperative” and “collaborative” tend to attract more women and turn away men.
:::

<UsageBlock>
  <template #correct>
    "workforce"
  </template>
  <template #incorrect>
    "manpower"
  </template>
</UsageBlock>

::: info Reasoning
Not gender neutral, renders women invisible.
:::

## Sexual orientation and gender identity
  ### Best practices
- Avoid language that reinforces the assumption that all personal relationships are heterosexual and denies the reality of same-sex relationships.

<UsageBlock>
  <template #correct>
    “spouse” or “partner”
  </template>
  <template #incorrect>
    “wife/husband” or “girlfriend/boyfriend”
  </template>
</UsageBlock>

::: info Reasoning
Reinforces the assumption that all relationships are heterosexual, and renders same-sex relationships invisible.
