## Abbreviations
  Abbreviations are any shortened or contracted word or phrase. Abbreviations can be convenient: they can also cause confusion if used incorrectly.

## Acronyms
Acronyms are a type of abbreviation. They shorten phrases in a specific way— using parts of the initial word or phrase (usually letters) to form an abbreviation. For example, DIY or ASAP.

## Technical language
Avoid any technical language and unfamiliar words, write in plain language. Our Shopware brand voice favors being <code>clear</code> and <code>direct</code> to all types of users, so use simple, commonly-understood language. If you need to use a technical term, briefly define it so everyone can understand.

If there’s a chance your reader won’t recognize an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time you mention it. Then use the short version for all other references.

::: info Tipp
If the abbreviation or acronym is well known, like API or HTML, use it instead (and don’t worry about spelling it out).
