## Words matter
At Shopware, the tone of voice that fosters meaningful connections with our audience, plays a central role in our brand identity. Our approach to tone of voice extends beyond words and encapsulates the essence of our brand personality, values, and the emotions we aim to evoke in every interaction. Through a consistent and authentic tone, we aim to resonate with our users, establish trust, and create memorable experiences that reflect our commitment to innovation, reliability, and customer-centricity.

        <h3>Empower</h3>
        <p>Help people understand Shopware by using language that informs them and encourages them to make the most of our products.</p>

        <h3>Respect</h3>
        <p>Treat readers with the respect they deserve. Put yourself in their shoes, and donâ€™t patronise them. Remember that they have other things to do. Be considerate and inclusive.</p>

        <h3>Educate</h3>
        <p>Tell readers what they need to know, not just what we want to say. Give them the exact information they need, along with opportunities to learn more. Remember that youâ€™re the expert, and readers donâ€™t have access to everything you know.</p>

## ðŸ’¬ Our Approach
In order to achieve these goals, we make sure our content adheres to these values.

<div class="section-thumbnails">
    <div class="section-thumbnails--card info custom-block">
<picture class="section-thumbnails--image">
<source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/product-experience/section-thumbnails-clear@dark.png 4x">

<img class="class" decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="A sketch of the Accessibility icon. The image is tinted in shades of green." srcset="/product-experience/section-thumbnails-clear.png 4x" src="/product-experience/section-thumbnails-clear.png" width="100%" height="auto">
</picture>
        <h3>Clear</h3>
        <p>Understand the topic youâ€™re writing about. Use simple words and sentences.</p>
</div>
    <div class="section-thumbnails--card info custom-block">

<source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/product-experience/section-thumbnails-useful@dark.png 4x">

<img class="class" decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="A sketch of the Accessibility icon. The image is tinted in shades of green." srcset="/product-experience/section-thumbnails-useful.png 4x" src="/product-experience/section-thumbnails-useful.png" width="100%" height="auto">
</picture>
        <h3>Useful</h3>
        <p>Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section-thumbnails mb-[42px]">
        <div class="section-thumbnails--card info custom-block">

</picture>
        <h3>Friendly</h3>
        <p>Write like a human. Donâ€™t be afraid to break a few rules if it makes your writing more relatable. All of our content, from splashy website copy to system alerts, should be warm and human.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-thumbnails--card info custom-block">

</picture>
        <h3>Appropriate</h3>
        <p>Write in a way that suits the situation. Just like you do in face-to-face conversations, adapt your tone depending on who youâ€™re writing to and what youâ€™re writing about.</p>
